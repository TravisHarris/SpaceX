# SpaceX

This is a fan made interpretation of the SpaceX website by Travis Harris, I am not affiliated with SpaceX in anyway, the real website can be found at www.spacex.com

I made this website as a project for my web development portfolio, I am a huge fan of Elon Musk and his ventures, and while digging into several websites to figure out how they worked, I noticed that Spacex didn't have a mobile version of their website and decided to come up with something I thought would capture the feel for what the company represents. It is not 100% my design, the framework was borrowed from the official Tesla website @ www.tesla.com. Although they are too drastically different companies and industries, I felt they should go hand in hand as they are both of Musk's children.
